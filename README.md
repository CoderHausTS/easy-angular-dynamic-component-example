Dynamic Component test project.

This project aims to show a an easy method of adding dynamic components to your Angular apps.

While looking through examples, including that shown on Angular's own site https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader, I found that the examples were much more complex than was needed. This led to my pulling a few of these examples apart and determining the absolute minimum need to load dynamic components.

The example I came up with is shown here, using a dropdown to select which component will be shown.

More information about this example can be found at {to be developed}

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
